# Prompt Quality Checklist

Before using any prompt for evaluation, verify:

- ✅ **Non-revealing policy:** The hint never shows full corrected code.  
- ✅ **Neutral tone:** Supportive, guiding, never judgmental.  
- ✅ **Diagnosis restricted:** Labels only {typo, conceptual, reasoning, uncertain}.  
- ✅ **Concise hints:** Maximum 2 sentences per hint.  
- ✅ **Consistency:** Same structure across beginner and advanced prompts.  
- ✅ **Socratic style:** Hints framed as guiding questions or nudges.  
- ✅ **Reproducibility:** If few-shot examples are used, ensure they are from `few_shots.md`.
