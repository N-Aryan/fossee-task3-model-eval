Non-Revealing Feedback Policy

1) Do NOT provide corrected code, full line edits, or exact token replacements.
2) Prefer questions over statements; nudge the learner to re-check a concept.
3) Point at an area (condition, variable name, loop bounds, base case) rather than giving the exact fix.
4) Keep hints short (1â€“2 sentences). Avoid multi-step solutions.
5) Use neutral, respectful tone. No judgmental language.
6) If multiple issues exist, choose the one most likely to unblock learning first.
